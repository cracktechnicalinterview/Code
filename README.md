# About Technical Interview

This channel is dedicated to demystifying the questions asked in interviews of Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Oracle, and Amazon.
In this channel, I do live coding in my videos explaining each and every line of code, with proper justification and explanation of the algorithmic approach to solve the problems.

Unlike other channels,  where they directly say we will use this Data Structure or Algorithm without even explaining the reason why they are using. In this channel, we tell the viewers why a particular Data Structure or Algorithm is being used. So, that during the interview if you face any new problem, you can solve the problem efficiently with confidence.

My name is Anindya, currently working as a member of the recruitment team among one of the tech giants I mentioned above :P.
